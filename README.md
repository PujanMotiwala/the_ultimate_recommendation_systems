# The Ultimate Recommendation Systems

## Project Overview
This project explores various recommendation system techniques, starting with a simple K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model. More approaches will be added over time, providing a comprehensive guide to building different types of recommendation systems.

## Folder Structure
- `approaches/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for different recommendation system models.
- `LICENSE`: License file for the project.
- `README.md`: Detailed project description and setup instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `approaches/` folder to explore different recommendation system models and techniques.

## Current Approaches
1. **Simple KNN Model**: A basic implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for movie recommendations.
